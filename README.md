### Final Project for Stats 133

#### Description of the Project -

Analyze the correlation between GDP per year and the yearly box office total from 1980 to 2014.

We want to see how the box office responds to the changes of the economy and how the popularity of the genres changed over the years. We also want to look at individual titles (the box office hit of the year) and analyze if there is a correlation between the amount it earned and the total box office of the year.
