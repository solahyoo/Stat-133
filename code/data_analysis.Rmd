Import data 
```{r}
top_movie <- read.csv('C:/Users/tjf00_000/OneDrive/Documents/finalproj/data/top_grossing_movie_yearly.csv')
```
Find the average total domestic box office by genre.
```{r}
avg <- aggregate(top_movie[, 4:5], list(top_movie$Genre), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
colnames(avg)[1] <- 'Genre'


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
